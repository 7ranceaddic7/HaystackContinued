KSP-Haystack-Plugin
===================

Plugin for [Kerbal Space Program](http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) which helps to easily switch vessels and targets.

Original code written by hermes-jr, with additions for compatibility by enamelizer.

Building
--------
1. Add references to the Assembly-CSharp and UnityEngine assemblies from the version of KSP you wish to target. (A plugin build targeted to one version may not work on another, even if no code changes are necessary for compatibility.)
2. Build in Release configuration. This will copy the Release DLL to \GameData\HrmHaystack\.
3. Zip and release to the world.

Reporting Issues
----------------
Please provide as much detail as possible when reporting an issue. That said, if you encounter an issue and aren't able to pin down the cause, post it and explain what you've tried so far. Some bugs are difficult to reproduce, and we need to know about them anyway.
